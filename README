Deli Counter Simulator - Kathleen Law

This is a simple program which simulates a deli counter interaction.
With a relational database created and manipulated with SQL, customer information,
as well as deli product information, is stored. In order to use all
of this data to mimic the deli environment, I implemented a Java program to
print sample dialogue for each customer order, specifying what product they
want and how much the final order would cost, given the desired weight of the
product.

This project contains 3 main files. The "src" folder contains the Java program file.
"Law_DeliCounter.db" is the relational database file, with all of the data needed for
the simulator to run properly. Finally, the "sqlite-jdbc-3.23.1.jar" file is the JDBC
driver, which is a downloadable API that allows Java to connect with SQL databases.
The Java program is unable to reach my database without this driver in place, and thus
is included in this project as well.
